## ❄️ Frozen Screen Bug (Pageflip Timeout)

- **Symptom:** One monitor freezes or entire desktop becomes unresponsive under KDE Wayland.
- **Cause:** `Pageflip timed out! This is a bug in the nvidia-drm kernel driver` (see journal logs).
- **Temporary Fix:**
  - Switch to a TTY: `Ctrl + Alt + F3` (or F2/F4)
  - Return to graphical session: `Ctrl + Alt + F1`
  - This refreshes the compositor without rebooting or killing session. Or also logging off and logging back in.

✅ **Update:** As of **NVIDIA Open Beta DKMS 575** and recent **CachyOS 6.14 kernel**, this pageflip timeout issue appears resolved under standard usage.

## 🛠️ Workarounds (historical)
- Previously tested with TKG kernel (reduced occurrence)
- Alternative: Use GNOME (issue did not occur)
- Required kernel parameter or env var tweaks before fixes arrived.

## 📎 Notes
- Session was not killed—refresh only.
- Logout or reboot also resolved temporarily.
- Originally tied to power management or multi-monitor setups on NVIDIA.

> 🛡️ System is now stable under **KDE + Wayland + NVIDIA Open 575** + **CachyOS 6.14** kernel with AMD 7950X3D architecture.
