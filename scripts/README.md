## üîç About

This is a curated, professional-grade collection of ZSH-powered scripts for managing and optimizing my **personal Arch Linux workstation** setup. Focused on:

- Automating post-install tasks
- Bulletproof kernel upgrades and fallbacks
- Secure GPG key syncing
- Full system resilience and rollback ability

Every script here is designed for **speed**, **stability**, and **GhostKellz-level efficiency**.
